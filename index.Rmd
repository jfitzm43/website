### Filtering Columns and Rows

When using dplyr, you can filter columns and rows by using select and filter. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. We first have to load the Lahman and dyplr packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 New York Yankees. We could run the following code:

```{r warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & yearID=='1927')
```

### Examples:

Using the Lahman database i want to find all the instances wheere Yankees players have hit 40 homeruns or more (playerID,teamID,yearID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR >= 40 & teamID == 'NYA')
```

This is just a different way to put the dplyr code for filter and select:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR >=40 & teamID == 'NYA')%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)
```

Find all instances where a player had more than 40 HR but less than 60 strikeouts(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR > 40 & SO<60)%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO)
```

Find all instances of Phillies in the 1970's hitting more than 30 HR (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID =='PHI' & yearID>=1970 & yearID<1980 & HR>30)
```

Find every instance of a player hitting more than 50 homeruns but let's have the players with the most homeruns at the top (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

Find all instances of a player striking out less than 10 times, players have to have at lease 400 AB. Players with the smallest number of strikeouts at the top (playerID,yearID,teamID,SO,AB):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,SO,AB)%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>=400)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

Another way to do the same excersice where we filter first and then select. This is just to avoid putting the AB column in the results.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>=400)%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,SO)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```
