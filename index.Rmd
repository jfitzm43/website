### Filtering Columns and Rows in the Lahman database and dplyr using RStudio:

When using dplyr, you can filter columns and rows by using select and filter. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. We first have to load the Lahman and dyplr packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 New York Yankees. We could run the following code:

```{r warning=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & yearID=='1927')
```

### Ordering examples with the Lahman database and dplyr:

1. Using the Lahman database i want to find all the instances wheere Yankees players have hit 40 homeruns or more (playerID,teamID,yearID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR >= 40 & teamID == 'NYA')
```

1.1. This is just a different way to put the dplyr code for filter and select:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR >=40 & teamID == 'NYA')%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)
```

2. Find all instances where a player had more than 40 HR but less than 60 strikeouts(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR > 40 & SO<60)%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO)
```

3. Find all instances of Phillies in the 1970's hitting more than 30 HR (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID =='PHI' & yearID>=1970 & yearID<1980 & HR>30)
```

4. Find every instance of a player hitting more than 50 homeruns but let's have the players with the most homeruns at the top (playerID,yearID,teamID,HR):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

5. Find all instances of a player striking out less than 10 times, players have to have at lease 400 AB. Players with the smallest number of strikeouts at the top (playerID,yearID,teamID,SO,AB):

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,SO,AB)%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>=400)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

5.1. Another way to do the same excersice where we filter first and then select. This is just to avoid putting the AB column in the results.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>=400)%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,SO)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

### Examples of agreggation functions in R using the Lahman database and dplyr:

1. Find the total career HR's for Babe Ruth.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(playerID == 'ruthba01')%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR = sum(HR))
```

2. Find the career HR totals for all players, but limit the list to those who have a career total off 600 or more. Put the highest totals at the top.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR = sum(HR))%>%
  filter(career_HR >= 600)%>%
  arrange(desc(career_HR))
```

3. What players have the highest average HR totals.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(HRAvg = mean(HR))%>%
  filter(HRAvg > 30)%>%
  arrange(desc(HRAvg))
```

4. What player since 1970, have hit more than 50 HR at least once. Dont list a player more than once.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(yearID >= 1970)%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(maxHR=max(HR))%>%
  filter(maxHR>50)%>%
  select(playerID)
```

4.1. This is a different way to get the same result.

```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(yearID >= 1970 & HR > 50)%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(maxHR = max(HR))%>%  
  select(playerID)
```

## Conclusion:
At the end of this section you should be able to understand and apply the basics of dplyr in RStudio.
